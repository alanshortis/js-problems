# JavaScript problems

> Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript, for practice or interview prep.

## Set up

Install dependencies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), which includes NPM.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), installed globally: `npm i -g jest`.

## Solving problems

Within each problem's folder, there are three files:

- **problem.js** contains a brief description of the problem to be solved, and an empty function in which to add your solution.
- **test.js** contains Jest tests to verify that your solution does what's expected. You don't have to read the tests to solve the problems, but tests act as another layer of documentation of the function being written so it's worth getting familiar with them.
- **solution.js** contains at least one solution to the problem. Try not to look in here until you've written your own solution or you're really stuck.

## Running tests

To verify that your solutions do what's expected, tests are run against `problem.js` for each problem. Tests will fail for each problem until a passing solution is added.

- To run tests for a specific problem on save: `jest <folder name>/test.js --watch`.
- To run tests for all problems: `jest`.

## Adding problems

To add a new problem to the repo, there is a small CLI to help create the required folder and files with a barebones function and test. Run `node new-problem.js` and follow the prompts.
